Welcome to a guide for modding your 3ds's home menu. This guide is split into modules with no specific order, with the exception of [Start](/start). The [Start](/start) modules will take you through the steps and prereqisites for modding your home menu. In this guide I assume you have a Nintendo 3ds running Luma CFW.

If you have any questions please ask them on the [Custom 3DS Assets Discord](https://discord.gg/0z7IGZ5Sv3D0mEN0){:target="_blank"}.

To get started check out the [Start](/start) module! After completing that please click on any other module to learn how to do the edits mentioned in its name.
