    - EUR: `00009802`

    - KOR: `0000A902`

# Preparing Your Home Menu for Modifications

### Downloads
[HMRT](https://github.com/schrmh/HMRT){:target="_blank"}
    
### Steps    
1. Download and extract HMRT. 
2. Make a copy of your home menu and name it `HomeMenu.cia`
3. Open the HMRT script for your OS (bat is windows, sh is Linux and Mac) 
    - The windows version of HMRT can have some issues. If you run into any just use the Linux sh script in WSL. 
4. Select option `1` to extract your home menu CIA. 
5. Then select option `5` to decompress all the files we will be editing.

Note: HMRT does not work in mac parallels.
  
  
  
# LayeredFS
In this guide, we will be using layeredfs, as it is better for faster iterations and is easier to undo if you break something. Files are loaded from the sd card in place of the ones that are inside the application files, similar to what [Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk){:target="_blank"} does on Android.

### On 3ds
1. Hold select on boot. 
2. Enable game patching.
3. Hit start to save. 

### Sd card setup
1. Insert your SD card into your pc.
2. Navigate to `sd:/luma/titles`.
3. Create a folder with the full title id of your home menu region.
	- EUR: `0004003000009802`
	- JPN: `0004003000008202`
	- KOR: `000400300000A902`
	- USA: `0004003000008F02`
4. After making edits, select option `6` in HMRT.
5. Place your edited file on the SD card in the folder you just created, in the same directory structure it was in the extracted home menu.
	- (eg. `sd:/luma/titles/0004003000008F02/romfs/sleep_LZ.bin`)
